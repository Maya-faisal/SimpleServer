Part A
Using socket programming, implement a simple complete web server in Python that is listening on port 9977.

1. If the request is `/`, `/index.html`, `/main_en.html`, or `/en` (for example `localhost:9977/` or `localhost:9977/en`), then the server should send `main_en.html` file with `Content-Type: text/html`.
2. If the request is `/ar`, then the server should respond with `main_ar.html`, which is an Arabic version of `main_en.html`.
3. If the request is an `.html` file, then the server should send the requested HTML file with `Content-Type: text/html`.
4. If the request is a `.css` file, then the server should send the requested CSS file with `Content-Type: text/css`.
5. If the request is a `.png`, then the server should send the PNG image with `Content-Type: image/png`.
6. If the request is a `.jpg`, then the server should send the JPEG image with `Content-Type: image/jpeg`.
7. Use the status code 307 Temporary Redirect to redirect the following:
   - If the request is `/yt`, then redirect to the YouTube website.
   - If the request is `/so`, then redirect to stackoverflow.com website.
   - If the request is `/rt`, then redirect to the Ritaj website.
8. If the request is wrong or the file doesnâ€™t exist, the server should return a simple HTML webpage that contains `Content-Type: text/html`.

Part B
Using socket programming, implement UDP client and server applications in Python. The server should listen on port 8855. The client sends broadcast messages every 2 seconds.
